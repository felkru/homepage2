Studying can be stressful!\
\
I feel most problems students face can be boiled down to three main categories:
1. Not spending enough time studying (distractions, procrastination, lack of motivation)
2. Not making the right strategic decisions before studying (time management, inefficient study techniques)
3. Not thinking the right thoughts whilst studying (anxiety, stress, intelligence)

I haven't yet been fully immersed into a study program yet so take everything I say with a grain of salt. These tips are a combination of my experience studying for the courses I have already taken, working on a startup and observing other students who are studying with various degrees of success and happiness.

## 1. Relaxation is productive!
The one thing that I see a lot of people failing at is relaxing properly. "What?" you might say "I'm spending most of my time procrastinating. How could relaxation be my problem? I need to study more." Well, you're right. Kind of.

I observe that a lot of people always keep their work in the back of their minds. How do I know?
