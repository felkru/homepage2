What i want to achieve with this blog:

1. Inspire others to pursue particle physics
2. Share my enthusiasm
3. Show people how they can connect with me

## What quarks look like

Welcome to my blog, where I share my enthusiasm for particle physics with all of you! As an aspiring physicist, delving into the study of the universe's smallest building blocks and their fascinating properties fills me with awe. Today, I'm excited to take you on a journey through the world of particle physics, offering some intriguing insights into this captivating field of research. Skip directly to [the LHC](#the-lhc) if you want to know more about the Large Hadron Collider.

| Particles | charge   | weight ($10^{-31}$ kg) |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Elektron  | negative | 9.1093837015           |
| Proton    | positive | 16724.828475           |

Particle physics concerns itself with the fundamental constituents of matter and the fundamental forces that hold them together. It's astonishing to realize that everything we see and feel around us is composed of tiny particles interacting with one another. From quarks and leptons to the forces that influence them, particle physics has unveiled many mysteries, yet many more await discovery.

One remarkable area within particle physics is the Standard Model, which describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. Despite its impressive successes, there are still unanswered questions and phenomena lying beyond its scope. Dark matter, dark energy, and the unification of fundamental forces are just some of the major puzzles that scientists around the globe are investigating.
My formula goes:

$
T^{i_1 i_2 \dots i_p}_{j_1 j_2 \dots j_q} = T(x^{i_1},\dots,x^{i_p},e_{j_1},\dots,e_{j_q})
$

Einstein proposed the formula $E = mc^2$ in 1905. Work on large-scale experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN allows us to delve deeper into the world of particle physics. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was a significant milestone that fundamentally changed our understanding of mass. Such discoveries are the result of intensive research and international collaboration, contributing to unraveling the secrets of the universe. This kind of research often has unexpected outcomes and nobody can predict how it will change the world.

## The LHC
